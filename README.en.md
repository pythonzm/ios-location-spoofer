# iOS Location Spoofer

**English** · [中文](README.md)

Use the HTTPS-decryption (MITM) feature of a proxy app to trick Apple's location service — and therefore Apple Maps — into placing your iPhone anywhere in the world.

## Credits

This project builds on the core research of [acheong08/ios-location-spoofer](https://github.com/acheong08/ios-location-spoofer). The original is a standalone iOS app written in Go that spoofs location with a self-hosted VPN + MITM proxy.

This repo re-implements that core logic in JavaScript and adapts it to five proxy platforms — Shadowrocket, Surge, Loon, Quantumult X, and Stash — so there's nothing to compile and no developer account required. Import and go.

### What this port adds over the original

- **Multi-platform support** — from a single iOS app to five proxy apps.
- **Cell-tower coordinate rewriting** — the Go original only rewrote Wi-Fi hotspot coordinates; the JS version also rewrites CellTower coordinates (fields 22/24).
- **Multiple response-format compatibility** — auto-detects Apple's response envelope (ARPC / synthetic / marker / bare) so the rewritten payload is still accepted by iOS.
- **Motion-state spoofing** — also rewrites `motionActivityType` and `motionActivityConfidence` to reduce the chance of detection.

## How it works

Your iPhone reads nearby Wi-Fi and cell signals, then asks Apple where those BSSIDs/towers are. Apple replies with a list of coordinates, and iOS computes its own position from them.

This project intercepts Apple's reply on the way back and rewrites every coordinate to the numbers you chose. iOS receives the altered coordinates and concludes it is exactly where you told it to be.

> Tested it? Please report results in Issues. If something doesn't work, PRs are welcome — at minimum include **which app, which version, which iOS, and the raw error log**.

## Usage

1. Turn on HTTPS decryption / MITM in your proxy app.
2. Install and trust the CA certificate (Settings → General → VPN & Device Management → install, then Certificate Trust Settings → enable).
3. Import the module file and enable it.
4. Reconnect the VPN and toggle Location Services off/on.
5. Open Maps to verify.

### MITM failed troubleshooting

If the proxy Request List shows `MITM failed`, this usually points to MITM hostname matching or iOS certificate full-trust state, not to the rewrite script having already failed. Please verify:

1. iOS has full trust enabled for the proxy CA under **Settings → General → About → Certificate Trust Settings**.
2. The failing Host in Request List is present in the module's `[MITM] hostname` list. Every module in this project includes `gs-loc.apple.com`, `gs-loc-cn.apple.com`, `gsp-ssl.ls.apple.com`, `bluedot.is.autonavi.com`, and `bluedot.is.autonavi.com.gds.alibabadns.com`.
3. If your log shows another `/clls/wloc` Host, please include the exact Host and path in the issue instead of using broad wildcards such as `*.apple.com` / `*.ls.apple.com`, which may MITM unrelated Apple requests.
4. If it still fails, try disabling QUIC/HTTP3-related options, reconnect the VPN, then toggle Location Services off/on.

### Loon notes

1. After importing `ios-location-spoofer.lnplugin`, open the plugin config page under **Settings → Plugins**.
2. You can enter **latitude / longitude** directly. **Address search** is resolved and cached by a cron task that runs every 15 minutes (for the first run, enter coordinates directly or save an address and wait one cron cycle).
3. You must enable Loon's **MITM** and trust the certificate, and the four domains in the plugin's `[mitm]` block must be active.
4. The plugin includes a **Prepare** request script (sets `Accept-Encoding: identity` to avoid gzip-induced `zip decompress error` / script timeouts).
5. After changing coordinates, toggle Location Services off/on. For debugging, enable **debug logging** and search Loon's log for `Location spoofer`.

> If the log shows `Evaluate script timeout` or `zip decompress error:-3`: update the plugin and reload Loon, and confirm all three scripts (Prepare / Response / Geocode cron) are enabled.

## Changing coordinates

Default is Apple Park (37.3349, -122.00902). Change it in the module arguments:

```
latitude=39.9042&longitude=116.4074
```

| Name | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `latitude` | 37.3349 | Target latitude |
| `longitude` | -122.00902 | Target longitude |
| `address` | (empty) | Address search (entered in the Loon plugin UI; resolved to coordinates online; takes precedence over manual lat/lng) |
| `horizontalAccuracy` | 39 | Horizontal accuracy |
| `verticalAccuracy` | 1000 | Vertical accuracy |
| `altitude` | 530 | Altitude |
| `failOpen` | true | Pass the original data through on error |
| `debug` | false | Debug logging |

```

## Optional: web map location picker

Change location often and tired of looking up coordinates by hand? The bundled [`location-picker/`](location-picker/) tool lets you tap a map to set your location: altitude is filled in automatically and accuracy is adjustable. Loon / Shadowrocket read it via `configUrl`.

**Four deployment options:**

| Option | Directory | Best for |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Cloudflare Worker — Wrangler CLI** (recommended) | [`location-picker/worker/`](location-picker/worker/) | No VPS, HTTPS included; comfortable with the CLI |
| **Cloudflare Worker — dashboard** | [`location-picker/cloudflare-webui/`](location-picker/cloudflare-webui/) | No VPS, HTTPS included; no npm/Wrangler — paste a single file |
| Self-hosted Node | [`location-picker/server.js`](location-picker/server.js) | You have your own VPS / NAS |
| Docker | [`location-picker/Dockerfile`](location-picker/Dockerfile) | You have Docker |

Loon plugin **remote config URL** example:

```
https://your-worker.workers.dev/loc.json?token=YOUR_TOKEN
```

## Community

This project welcomes review and feedback from the LINUX DO community: [LINUX DO](https://linux.do)

## location-picker server configuration

`location-picker/server.js` is controlled by environment variables. **If `TOKEN` is not set, the process exits immediately — it will never fall back to a weak default.**

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `TOKEN` | **Yes** | none | Access token. Must match the `token=` in the `configUrl` at the end of the proxy module's `argument=`. Generate one with `openssl rand -hex 24`. |
| `PORT` | No | `8080` | Listen port; ports below 1024 require root. |
| `CERT` | No | empty | HTTPS fullchain certificate path; HTTPS is used only when both `CERT` and `KEY` are set. |
| `KEY` | No | empty | HTTPS private key path; used only when both `CERT` and `KEY` are set. |
| `DATA_FILE` | No | `loc.json` next to `server.js` | Current-location data file path. |
| `FAVORITES_FILE` | No | `favorites.json` next to `DATA_FILE` | Favorite-locations data file path. |
| `AMAP_KEY` | No | empty | Amap “Web Service” key. When set, Amap POI search is preferred, with automatic OpenStreetMap fallback. |

Startup examples:

```bash
# http (simplest — get the flow working before switching to https)
TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 24) PORT=8080 node server.js

# https (reuse acme.sh certs; no restart needed on renewal — the process hot-reloads every 12 hours)
TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 24) PORT=8443 \
CERT=/root/cert/example.com/fullchain.pem \
KEY=/root/cert/example.com/privkey.pem \
node server.js
```

For Amap-quality POI results in China, create an application in the [Amap developer console](https://console.amap.com/dev/key/app), add a **Web Service** key, and set `AMAP_KEY` through systemd `Environment=` / `EnvironmentFile=` or `direnv`. Running `node server.js` directly **does not load `.env` automatically**; Docker Compose does load `.env` from this directory. Do not use a “Web (JS API)” key.

The data file `loc.json` is written next to `server.js` and records the current coordinates / altitude / accuracy. Favorites are stored in `favorites.json` in the same directory and are restored from the server after browser data is cleared. Both files are listed in `.gitignore`, so they won't be committed to the repo by accident.

> ⚠️ **Don't put `TOKEN` in your shell history.** Prefer systemd's `Environment=` or `.env` + `direnv` to avoid leaking it via `history` / `ps aux`.

### Docker

```bash
cd location-picker
echo "TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 24)" > .env
# Optional: echo "AMAP_KEY=your-amap-web-service-key" >> .env
docker compose up -d
```

Based on `node:22-alpine`. Data volume mounts to current directory. `restart: unless-stopped`.

## Security note

The Cloudflare Worker versions and `server.js` all require a token on every endpoint (including the map page). Token comparison is constant-time, and `server.js` refuses to start without a `TOKEN`. Because MITM decryption sees all traffic to the intercepted Apple endpoints, only enable the module while you actively need it, and keep your CA private key on-device only.
